## User Stories-(Arcane Pairs)

1. As a user, I want to be able to click start. Which in turn will start a timer letting me know how long i have to match every pair.

2. AAU, I would like to display a timer on the game allowing the user to know how much time they have left.

3. AAU, I want every face down card to have something unique to let the user know that it has not been flipped yet.

4. AAU, when I click on a face down card, I would like that card to show its image underneath. Also would like to allow one more click before the two mis-selections face the cards back down again.
   would also like to see where the mix of cards are postioned at the start of the game.

5. AAU, I want to see where the mix of cards are postioned at the start of the game as well as correct pairs to stay flipped up.

6. AAU, I want the grid to be 4x3.

7. AAU, I want to enable difficulty levels which will reflect on the total amount of time to complete each pair.

8. AAU, If the user does complete every pair, I would like to display a notification on the screen. "Congrats You've Won". If not, "Sorry, Try Again"

9. AAU, I would like their to be a reset button, which will allow the user to reset the board to attempt the game again.
