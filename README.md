### Future Steps

1. Implement a difficulty aspect which will adjust the timer according to difficulty choices. "Easy", "Medium", "Hard"

2. Get my shuffle animation to work properly as well as add a flipping feature.

3. Implement a feature to show the cards prior to starting the game. Then hiding them after the time starts.

4. Implement media queries to properly keep the the 4x3 grid on different resolutions.

5. Would like to clean up my win/loss statements to be more appealing.

6. Clean up css placement on elements. Specifically with flexbox.
